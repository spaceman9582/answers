 *
 * A word of explanation on the architecture of the ThumbsUp class may be helpful, I guess. Its
 * structure had to be thought-through seriously because of the mix of ingredients it needs to
 * be able to handle. It needs to handle new votes in POST requests. It must be able to send
 * cookies before any output has been sent. Also it needs to be designed for multiple setups
 * of ThumbsUp integrated in a single page.
 *
 * The first thing to note is that no output must have been sent to the browser yet, if we want
 * to be able to set cookies. That is why we need to check POST data for new votes immediately
 * when this file is included at the top of the webpage. This is done by catch_vote(), called in
 * the constructor. If a new vote is successfully registered we update the cookie with the IDs
 * of the items the user already voted for.
 *
 * If a new vote is registered, valid or invalid, we need to show the feedback on the correspon-
 * ding item, and only on that item. Since multiple ThumbsUp items can be setup in one webpage,
 * we store the new vote feedback into the new_vote property. It will only be loaded, by
 * load_vote(), at the point when an item with the same ID is setup.
 *
 * There is more going on in the ThumbsUp class, of course, but it is good to have an idea of
 * the mechanics explained above. All the methods have been amply commented in the class itself.
 * Hope you learn something if you are going over the code!
